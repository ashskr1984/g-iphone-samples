DON'T…

Don't underestimate yourself.
不要低估自己

Don't refuse to listen.
不要拒绝聆听

Don't bottle things up.
不要遮遮掩掩

Don't expect life to be fair.
不要期望生活是公平的

Don't stick your head in the sand.
不要逃避现实

Don't beat your head against a brick wall.
不要自寻烦恼

Don't think the grass is greener on the other side.
不要见异思迁
